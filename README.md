This academic group project that we worked for our Database Management System course, creates a rainwater harvesting system that collects and purifies rainwater using advanced technology. It offers three water types: drinking, filtered, and directâ€”available for purchase on the website. Built with Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.
